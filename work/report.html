<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Before this assignment I knew the basic stuff about Git & GitHub. Markdown I have never heard about before. 
    Github Pages is also new to me. I Have not created a basic website since 2003. That was when i did a very basic webdevelopment course on comvux in Hässleholm. 
    My previous knowledge is limited. I have only used a little bit of html. I have never tried java script before. Looking forward to it. Seems overall like an interesting course.</p>
    <p>
    TIL: I have learnt about Tagging in git. Some basic html syntax and css. It was the first time I have tried forking on git. Got a good overview of the course.
