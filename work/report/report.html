        <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>Before this assignment I knew the basic stuff about Git & GitHub. Markdown I have never heard about before. 
            Github Pages is also new to me. I Have not created a basic website since 2003. That was when i did a very basic webdevelopment course on comvux in Hässleholm. 
            My previous knowledge is limited. I have only used a little bit of html. I have never tried java script before. Looking forward to it. Seems overall like an interesting course.</p>
            <p>TIL:<br> 
            I have learnt about Tagging in git. Some basic html syntax and css. It was the first time I have tried forking on git. Got a good overview of the course.

        <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
            Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
            Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
            What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>
                I have no prior experience in html except for a basic webdevelopment course i finished 15 years ago. I have used some css in other courses in this program. JavaScript i have no experience of.
                The role of html is to design the layout os the web pages. Css main purpose is to style the web page. JavaScript is used to make webpages dynamic. The interaction of the browser, http and the 
                server is that the client sends a request to the server using http. Then the server responds using http eg.  if it is a GET request and a webpage is requested this will be attached in the body of the response.   
            </p>
            <p>TIL:<br> 
            I have learned alot about different html markup tags. I also learned some new ways of using css. I did the learn web development. It was very informative.

        <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?<br>
                -None what so ever.
            </p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?<br>
                -I think it seems quite similar to java. 
            </p>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?<br>
            -There was alot of experimenting and testing before i decided on wich solution to use. I am aming for a 5. My code is nicely structured.
            </p>
            <p>TIL:<br> 
            I have deepened my js,css and html skills. Learned alot about how to generate html content from js. It was nice to try fetch.  
            </p>

        <h2>S04</h2>
        <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.<br>
            -None what so ever.
        </p>
        <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?<br>
            - I think it is fun. Js makes html pages more useful and dynamic. Node and Express was really nice. 
        </p>
        <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?<br>
            -It was alot of trail and error. I was very happy that the teacher made example code. This made it much easier to understand an getting started. 
        </p>
        <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the resul?<br>
            -I started with grade 3 requirements. Then moved on to 4 and finally 5. I am aming for a 5. I am  quite satisfied with my lotto solution  :)
        </p>
        <p>TIL:<br> 
        I have deepened my js,css and html skills. It was fun to try node and express. I got a basic understanding of express server.

        <h2>S05</h2>
        <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?<br>
            -I think it is really nice that it is only visible on the serverside. Feels safer than js. I really liked that php is loosely typed. It was really smooth to connect to database. There seems to be really nice ways to organise code with php.
        </p>
        <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?<br>
            -It reminds me of Java and c++. 
        </p>
        <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?<br>
            -I started with grade 3 requirements. Then moved on to 4 and finally 5. I am aming for a 5. It was kind of tricky at first i tried very many things just for fun. I am happy with the resulting code.
        </p>
        <p>TIL:<br> 
        I have earned my first ever php skills.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?<br>
                -It seems that the there is not alot of fast changes in the language market. At least if you look at the tiobe index where different languages are ranked over time.
                I think there will be a big shift when a new paradigm appears on the market. There are a lot of different languages but they are quite similar in the basics. 
                What differs is what frameworks they provide.
            </p>
            <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?<br>
                - I will be looking in to C# since they are rewriting their old .net to .net core wich is platform independant. I think this will increase in popularity. I think an important 
                parameter when selecting language is where the language is going. Is it being developed? How much effort is given in improving its codebase? Is it platform independant?
            </p>
            <p>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.<br>
                - I compared c# and java the result correlated with tiobe index that java is more popular. But C# seems to have 30 % of their combined market on google and 23% on tiobe index.
            </p>w
            <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?
                I would sell it based on which frameworks are available and how fast it is compared to others developing the type of applications that the employer is interested of. The employer likely already is 
                using a language and a framework that could be compared to others. But i think it is har to push for a new language. Maintainance and education will be more expensive to the company if it has a large 
                portfolio with varying languages and frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>TIL:<br> 
            I think the best learning of this lecture was about the different javascript flavors. Both tiobe and state of sscript was really interesting.
